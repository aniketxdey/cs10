## CS10: Object-Oriented Programming - Fall 2023

Course link here: https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~tjp/cs10/index.html

A collection of problem-sets and code I wrote for CS-10 in my first term at Dartmouth. Chose to put this on my Github since this class is essentially the fundamentals of data structures & algorithms.

Course Description: Motivated by problems that arise in a variety of disciplines, this course examines concepts and develops skills in solving computational problems. Topics covered include abstraction (how to hide details), modularity (how to decompose problems), data structures (how to efficiently organize data), and algorithms (procedures for solving problems). Laboratory assignments are implemented using object-oriented programming techniques.
Instructor: Professor Tim Pierson

Problem Set

Languages & Frameworks:
* Java
* REST & Django
* HTML & URL
  
Data Structures & Algorithms (+ Corresponding Problem Sets w/ Implementation):
* Linked Lists & Arrays (PS2)
* BST, Red-Black Trees (PS3)
* Maps, Sets, Stacks, & Queues (PS4)
* Hash Functions
* Priority Queues, Heaps (PS4)
* Graphs (PS4)
* DFS, BFS, Djisktra's (PS4)
* Finite Automata, HMM's (PS5)
* URL, REST, XML, GUI 
* Client-Server, synchronization (PS5)

### Problem Sets

* PS1: A webcam-based painting program in which some portion of the image (say your hand, or a marker tip) acts as a "paintbrush"

* PS2: A simulation of pointsb that collide and change colors/sizes/directions upon collision; applicable to physics & engineering problems

* PS3: Using Huffman encoding to compress and decompress files- brings together trees, maps, priority queues, and file i/o, all to help save the bits

* PS4: Implementing the Bacon game using DFS, BFS, and Graphs. Starting with an actor, see if they have been in a movie with someone who has been in a movie with someone who has been in a movie ... who has been in a movie with Kevin Bacon. Usually at most 6 steps away.

* PS5: Building a personal part of speech (POS) tagger that labels each word in a sentence with its part of speech (noun, verb, etc.) using Hidden Markov Models & Finite Automata.

* PS6: A collaborative graphical design editor â€” akin to Google Docs' or Canva's ability to have multiple simultaneous editors of the same document. Built with Client-Server Architecture.

### Misc
A ton of extra files that I used/created during the class. Chances are if there's ever a file missing execution-error in running any of these projects, the missing file is in here. A rough list of what this folder consists of:

* Short Assignments
* Templates/Class Provided Demo Files
* In-class exercises
* Practice midterm/final walkthroughs

## Enjoy!
